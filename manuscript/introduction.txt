# Introduction

Jekyll is the hero of this book. We will see how your websites or blogs can be quickly created and customized in Jekyll.

This book is intended for a semi-technical / non-technical audience. I am expecting people to have minimal or zero coding to get started and complete this book. Of course, this book is also a practical introduction - follow along to crteate your own beautiful blog or website.

I will be primarily referring to Windows platform since that is the only OS I am using right now. Contribute any updates for other OS on [GitHub](https://github.com/prashanth1k/levelup-your-sites-using-jekyll).


## What do you need to get started?

1.Install Ruby.
Download Ruby installer from [rubyinstaller.com](https://rubyinstaller.org/). You don't need to know Ruby. Everything in this book will be copy/paste, or specific commands - no unnecessary stuff.
2.Install Jekyll
Open command prompt - Press ```Windows + R``` to go to Run prompt, enter ```cmd``` and press enter.
In the command prompt: copy/paste the following command and press enter. 
```gem install jekyll bundler```

This installs Jekyll. Once the install is complete, you can cross-check by typing in ```jekyll -v``` in the same command prompt. 

That's pretty much it. Wasn't that easy?

Now, fast forward to creating your site!
