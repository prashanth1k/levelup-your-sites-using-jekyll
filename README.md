# Levelup your sites using Jekyll
The GitHub repository at  https://github.com/prashanth1k/levelup-your-sites-using-jekyll is input to LeanPub for creating a completely free book. The book is a non-technical introduction to Jekyll.

Create fast, secure websites, and host your sites/blog on world-class infrastructure - all for FREE. Jekyll is a wonderful platform, and I hope this book can put it in front of millions more :)
