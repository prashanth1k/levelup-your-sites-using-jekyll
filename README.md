# Levelup your Websites using Jekyll

The GitHub repository at https://github.com/prashanth1k/levelup-your-websites-using-jekyll is input to LeanPub for creating a completely free book. The book is a non-technical introduction to get started on and customize websites and blogs using Jekyll.

Create fast, secure websites, and host your sites/blog on world-class infrastructure - all for FREE. Jekyll is a wonderful platform, and I hope this book can put it in front of millions more :)
