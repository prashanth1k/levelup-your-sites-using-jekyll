# Introduction

Jekyll is the hero of this book. We will see how your websites or blogs can be quickly created and customized in Jekyll.

This book is intended for a semi-technical / non-technical audience. I am expecting people to have minimal or zero coding to get started and complete this book. Of course, this book is also a practical introduction - follow along to crteate your own beautiful blog or website.

I will be primarily referring to Windows platform since that is the only operating system I am using right now. Feel free to contribute any updates for other systems on [GitHub](https://github.com/prashanth1k/levelup-your-sites-using-jekyll).


## Why should I use Jekyll?
 - Free to develop
 - Free to host on world class platforms
 - Ability to scale for hundreds or thousands of users without additional money or effort


## What is the catch?
Static is Jekyll's middle name if indeed it had one.
Websites built by Jekyll may have functionality like blog posts, pages, images, video, user comments (through plugins), contact forms(plugins again) etc. but they are largely static. You will decide on the content, and include everything (almost) during creation.

You may find it difficult to do the following using a static website -
 - Enable a website where users can register themselves and login for additional content (e.g. membership sites)
 - Collect complex information from users, store and process that information
 - Do complex processing to show content dynamically based on various attributes (e.g. country, clicking on your ads to land on the website)

You will use Markdown to type content for Jekyll. It is not as simple as MS Word, but I promise this - once you got hold of writing in markdown in all of 30 min, you would never want to go back.


## What are my alternatives?
There are many.
If you are sold to static sites, you may want to consider -

 - [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/): ReactJS based framework. Somewhat more technical.
 - [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/): Uses Go to create static sites. Has clear, easy-to-follow steps like Jekyll but would need you to generate sites on your computer (or a server) for later uploads.


If you want more functionality offered by dynamic sites, consider -

 - [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) (of course!): Either pay for Wordpress hosting, or get [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) to host your site (for a fee if you want the perks)
 - Drag & drop platforms like [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com), [Wix](https://wix.com), [Squarespace](https://squarespace.com)


## What do you need to get started on Jekyll?

### Internet connection
Ha!

### Time
Ha, again.
You will need to spend 30-60 min for a world class blog!

Now, fast forward to creating your site. You will be up and running by the end of Chapter 2!
