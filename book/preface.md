# Preface

Consider the below for a moment -

* How about speeding up your websites to load in less than a second?
* What if you do not need to worry about security - for ever? (well, we will come back to that)
* You can do speedup your site and improve security for free using world-class infrastructure; the same infrastructure that can support thousands or hundreds of thousands of your users?
* What if you can do all the stuff yourself with minimal technology knowledge and don't need to pay anyone?

You save what - $20, $50, $1000 per month?

Well, I am delighted to report that such a tool existed for a long time now. Although it has been quite popular in developer circles, the platform does not get the same recognition it deserves from anyone else.

That platform is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

Wordpress has been my go-to friend for all blogs and even complex websites. It was a delight to just do a two minute install, drag and drop components to create a decent site, and go live within a day. Revolutionary - there are no doubts about that. 

However, I was bogged down with performance issues. I could not afford a decent enough host (or buy virtual private servers - VPS) due to budgetary constraints. Wordpress has to do some work to fetch data from database, and I respect that. But, seeing all that work for a simple blog page was painful.

It was at that point I started considering alternate platforms. After weighing out the big and small players - I decided to invest more time on Jekyll, the uncrowned king of static sites. 

Jekyll has a good number of themes and examples, a great community and an easy way to start - I was bowled over. I wanted to get the approach I followed to a non-technical or a "semi-technical" (is that a word?) user with this book. Collate information in one place so that you can quickly setup sites and move on to do greater things.

Let me make one point clear at the outset - I am not inventing anything said in this book. In fact, you will come across theme help pages and instructions covering most topics discussed here. What is different is the effort to consolidate, provide themes and options, and get you all things needed in a concise format.
