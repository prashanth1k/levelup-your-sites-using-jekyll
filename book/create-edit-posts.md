# Working with Posts

Posts are anything transient. They may be articles that are relevant for weeks/months, announcements, or your thoughts & ideas. 

Do you remember how hard was it to work with pages through SiteLeaf or Forestry? Well, it is about to get far worse. You would need to fill in two additional fields while creating posts - horror of horrors!


## Create New Posts

Logon to SiteLeaf. Head over to __Posts__ on the left hand-side navigation bar.

![Posts in SiteLeaf](resources\images\siteleaf-jekyll-posts.jpg)

You will see existing posts on your site. Click on __New Post__ button at the top to create new post. In addition to the content, update a category and a tag against the post.

![Create/Edit Posts(resources\images\siteleaf-edit-posts.jpg)

Categories are high-level categorisation of your website posts. e.g. Thoughts, Announcements, Games, Philosophy. Tags are specific, micro-level details in the post. For e.g. new-employee, idea, nihilism, Skyrim V.

There are no hard rules on what should constitute your categories and tags. Create a list of potential categories and tags in an Excel sheet, think over them for two days, and use them for your posts!


## Edit/Delete Posts

We now get to another difficult topic at hand. Editing posts.

Oh, who am I kidding - you would have already edited more than few posts by now. Just continue doing what you are doing. 

Play around with -

1. How to create images in the posts, what can you do to show posts with 'feature' images
2. Time-travel by changing the dates on the posts
3. Watch the fun by not allowing audience to comment on certain posts (hint: just look at the options below the main post content in SiteLeaf)

Feel free to delete the sample posts that came with the theme.

By now you have a full-fledged website with your own pages and posts! Congratulations! Don't forget to tweet at @techformist with your brand new website.


## Homework: Create 100 posts in 100 days

No kidding. That will make you the greatest blogger in your neighbourhood.
